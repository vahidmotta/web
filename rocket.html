                  <p> Rocket is the future of fundraising. It's a secure platform that allows you to create, buy, and sell digital assets on the blockchain. Two of my most significant contribution to this project was to ensure that the language was consistent and understandable to users and that the navigation was simplified and easy to use. Blockchain and cryptocurrency are not well understood. I had to make sure that users are capable of completing the process without being frustrated and leaving because of the terms, concepts, and jargon. A good website navigation is crucial. I was able to solve this problem and right away this web application became usable. Now the user can self identify whether they is interested in creating a digital asset as a company or whether he is a contributor seeking to provide funds to a company.</p>

                 <p> In this discovery phase, I began my research into learning about Blockchain, about traditional investing methods, about our service, and about our competitors. Getting to know the business and what value we bring to our clients is key to understanding where we fit in the market. My working experience was invaluable. I learned how important corporate culture is to the success of the business. When you have a diverse team of talented and creative individuals, sometimes everyone wants to take responsibility and roles become blurred which can cause conflicts between members of the same department and other departments. Luckily this was resolved using the project management tool or "responsiblity assignment matrix" called RACI. Once roles were more clear, productivity increase throughout the company.</p>

                 <p> Reaching our users was very difficult. Luckily our CEO had the connection to validate our assumptions about who our users were. We had two main users: companies and contributors. Companies could be start-ups looking to launch a digital asset to get more fundings and contributors were wealthy individuals seeking to fund these companies.</p>

                 <p> It will be interesting to see if the first launched STOs can make significant returns going forward. Positive results might accelerate STOs as a funding method as these first ones should pave the way. STO as a funding method might be the solution for the application layer within the blockchain. We are all aware of certain limitations that currently prevent blockchain applications to successfully launch on a large scale. The STOâ€™s that are launched can be classified overall as compliant ICOs rather than a real source of funding for a true blockchain application. We, therefore, do not expect positive results (and returns) from these initial STOs. We do not see significant investor demand from outside the crypto community as there are not enough success stories to tell yet.

                 <p>Upon reflection, there are some key learnings I want to remember from my experience. Meetings can be unproductive. This can be resolved by having "reviews" or feedback sessions. Daily standup meetings can last too long if the team is too big. In my opinion, smaller teams are more productive. One of the team members should be responsible for overseeing, delegating tasks, and keeping the team focused. CEOs need to establish good communication with team members and actually get involved. Most importantly, big problems cannot and should not be ignored. Temporary solutions or "quick fixes" actually hurt the company. A lot of busy work will result in projects failing since the big problems were not addressed. Also, team members need to feel that their work has purpose and that the company has a clear vision and plan. The path to success is never a straight line.</p>
