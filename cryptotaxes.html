              <div class="col-md-12 text-detail">
                 <p> In this discovery phase, I began my process with stakeholder interviews with accountants and developers. We identified that cryptotraders and CPAs not being able or not understanding how to file their cryptocurrency for tax purposes was a massive problem. The CRA has required every cryptotrader to file their taxes or else they could face penalities and possibly be charged with tax evasion. This business opportunity lead us to building our solution: <a target="_blank" href="https://crypto-taxes.tax/">https://crypto-taxes.tax</a></p>

              <div class="col-md-12 text-detail">
                 <p> From interviewing accountants, we realized that they cared about the process and they want to see how the tax calculations are done. Also, CRA compliancy and building their trust was very important them using our service. Accountants are also used to a certain process so we wanted to use their mental models and provide them with a familiar software (Excel) to input their client's transactions. From the interviews we were able to determine their needs and requirements.</p>

              <div class="col-md-12 text-detail">
                 <p> As mentioned earlier, the CRA is requiring all cryto-owners to report their cryptocurrency. there is a massive crisis and there are no good solutions until now. The market is demanding such a solution and we were able to deliver that solution for tax season 2019. Now the main difficulty is marketing and education of the service. My team was very close to have negotiations with a local accounting firm in Victoria that could of taken this to the next level.

                 <p>As lead UI/UX designer, I simplified the language and user journey to provide our users with guided information and easy steps to follow. We tested and validated the designs to make sure users were able to complete the steps. As a result, we have a fully functional SaaS product. As lead UX/I designer for this project I was responsible for the information architecture and I applied psychological principles to the wireframe using Brian Cugelman (PhD Senior Behavioral Scientist) course digital psychology.</p></p>

                 <p>Upon reflection, this project went smoothly. Our team worked cohesively to deliver a finished product. The design went through several iterations as there were multiple versions. As you can see my initial wireframe is diferent from the final visual design since we decided not make any videos for the lander due to time contraints. A key challenge for this project was to try to educate our users. Our solution was to provide a learning centre to aid and inform users on the different steps they had to complete.
